#About this Document
This is a brief outline of steps to get yourself up and running with R. It goes from installation of R and associated tools to a simple exercise. You may skip steps you are already comfortable.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

#Setting up R

## Get R & RStudio
These are the essential tools for using R.

1. Get the R from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/). There are installers and instructions for all platforms. The only complications are for Linux users, but they are used to that ;).
    * R comes with basic script editor, but it is rarely used.

2. RStudio is a tool for authoring R programs. It has unlimited use free versions available for all platforms. Get RStudio Desktop from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# First Steps

## Accessing CRAN
CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It houses over 10000(!) R packages that have been contributed by the community to perform all manner of data acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and visualisation tasks.

###Installing a package
Install your first package by running this command at the R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
```

Information on `readr`:

    * [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html)
    * [https://github.com/tidyverse/readr](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr)

###Exercise: Finding and installing Package
[CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) sort packages by the type of task they help you perform. Use the task view to find a package that seems like it might be useful in your work. Check out it's manual, vignettes, and then install it!

When Googling for packages the keywords "CRAN" or "rstats" can help you get straight to R package hits.

### Recommended package downloads
There are many useful packages to explore. Some recommendations:

* The `tidyverse` package incorporates some of the most famous R tools like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.
* `swirl` is a package that teaches you R inside R!
* `janitor` provides a simple library for solving data wrangling problems. 

#Exercise: Getting data into R
Getting data into R can create difficulties for people used to menu driven environments (Excel, SAS etc). Your objective is always to find an R function that can read the format of your data. Key packages that provide functions for you are : `readr` (csv), `readxl` (excel), and `haven` (other file-types).

In the repository alongside this file there is a csv file called `bank.csv` see if you can read it into an R data frame!

#Getting Help

## Cheatsheets

* RStudio maintain a range of [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) which are a excellent first port of call for when you get stuck for what to do.

## Stackoverflow
* The stackoverflow community for R is quite friendly and responds quickly. A package called `reprex` can help you arrange your code for posting in a request for help. BURGr's own Nick Tierney has written a [blog post about how to use it](http://www.njtierney.com/r/rbloggers/2017/01/11/reprex-magic/). 

#Joining the Community

## Twitter and #rstats
The R community on twitter is vibrant and fun. Keep an eye on the `#rstats` hashtag.

###Exercise: finding R on Twitter
Ask your fellow BURGr members for some good useR's to follow!

## Get a Github Account and a Client
Github is a service for hosting code repositories that is popular in the R community and (and in general). With a Github account you can:

* Keep track of the latest updates and happenings in the R package universe.
* Report bugs/issues for R packages you use.
* Store and share your own R projects with other people.
* Make contributions to packages that helps the whole community.

###Exercise: Get on Github!
If you're not yet on Github then it's time to get amongst it. Create an account and install a Github client like [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). Ask a fellow BURGr member to help you clone your first repo. For example [this one](https://github.com/AU-BURGr/data_exercises)!
